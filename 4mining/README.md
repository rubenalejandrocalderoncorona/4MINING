# Dash Financial Report

This is a demo of the [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code. To learn more about Dash, take a look at our [documentation](https://dash.plot.ly). If you're interested in deploying this application, check out [Dash Deployment Server](https://dash.plot.ly/dash-deployment-server/) - Plotly's commercial offering for hosting and sharing Dash Apps on-premise or in the cloud.
